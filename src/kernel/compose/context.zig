//! irregex compose — `context`: graded coverage packing inside the exact filter.
//!
//! The composed answer to "give me the minimal non-redundant reading set among
//! files that actually match these intents." `relate pack` over the whole
//! corpus surfaces whatever the corpus finds cheap regardless of the query's
//! exact intent; running the exact `PatternSet` first (`candidates.select`) and
//! pricing the query's aspects over ONLY the candidate docs measures novelty
//! inside the matching set, so the greedy submodular sweep (`coverage.zig`)
//! never spends a pick on a file the caller's patterns didn't hit.
//!
//! Pricing is deliberately LOCAL here. Inside a twelve-file `--matching` set,
//! a term one file holds is the most discriminating thing in the population
//! even though the whole corpus may be full of it — that is the entire point
//! of having narrowed first.
//!
//! Two scores stay honest and separate: each pick carries the exact
//! `mask` of patterns that admitted its file AND the compression `marginal_bits`
//! it adds beyond earlier picks — no fused relevance number. Pure kernel: the
//! driver loads the corpus and renders; this measures and packs.
