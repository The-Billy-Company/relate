//! Asking the same question twice — the CLI's side of the resident answer keep.
//!
//! Most of this package makes an expensive question cheaper. Some questions
//! have no cheaper form: `relate echoes --shape distinct` asks which of twenty
//! thousand files has no kin, which is a statement about every pair, and there
//! is no index over "every pair". The sweep is the answer, so the only thing
//! left to elide is a sweep already done over the same bytes.
//!
//! This module is that elision, and it is deliberately shaped so it cannot be
//! anything else:
//!
//! * **The daemon never computes.** It holds rendered bytes against a corpus
//!   change epoch and compares numbers. A keep that cannot recompute cannot
//!   recompute differently.
//! * **The key is the whole question.** Not a hash — the literal tool, verb,
//!   argv, working directory, every environment knob that can move an answer,
//!   and the identity of the binary that produced it. Two runs share an entry
//!   only if there is nothing left that could make them differ.
//! * **The copy is a tee, not a buffer.** Output goes to the terminal as it
//!   always did (`corpus.carbonOn`); the copy rides alongside. An early exit or
//!   a closed pipe costs a keep entry, never a byte of the answer.
//! * **A recall says so.** Stdout is byte-identical to the cold run — that is
//!   the whole contract — but stderr closes with a `recalled` line instead of
//!   the verb's own summary, because that summary's counts and milliseconds
//!   describe work this run did not do.
//!
//! Every failure is silence. No daemon, a stale protocol, a watcher that cannot
//! vouch for an epoch, an oversized answer — the verb then behaves exactly as
//! it did before this module existed. It never STARTS a daemon either: that
//! lifecycle is `gist`'s, and the keep is a passenger on it.
