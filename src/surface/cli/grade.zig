//! The weak-result verdict: what an answer amounted to, said out loud.
//!
//! `relate similar fresh.zig` returning 0.7813 looks like a result and reads
//! like a result, but every row is past the 0.50 line where kinship stops
//! meaning "related" and starts meaning "both are Zig" — and nothing in the
//! output said so. The calibration lived only in prose
//! (the package docs), which the binary's caller does not have.
//!
//! The vocabulary and its bands are kernel facts and live there
//! (`kernel/kinship/metric/channel.zig`); this module re-exports them so every
//! face keeps one import, and owns the two surface halves:
//!
//!   • **Sift** — the emit ledger every ranking verb runs: cap at `--top`, gate
//!     rows whose file vanished since the index anchor, remember the strongest
//!     score BEFORE withholding, withhold anything under `--min-grade`. Four
//!     verbs each hand-rolled this loop and drifted; now they share it.
//!   • **Verdict** — what the answer amounted to, rendered on stderr in gist's
//!     hint grammar, plus the rg-shaped exit code that goes with it.
