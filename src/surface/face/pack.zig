//! relate — the `pack` verb: the reading set for a task, priced in bits.
//!
//!   relate pack <text> [--matching PAT]... [--match any|all] [-F] [-i]
//!                      [--min-grade G] [--top N] [--json] [ROOT...]
//!       the SET of files that jointly explains <text> best — greedy graded
//!       coverage over corpus-priced query aspects, each pick scored by the
//!       bits it adds BEYOND what the picks before it already explained, and
//!       named for the aspects it is there for.
//!
//! Why this is a different question from ranking: any top-K retriever
//! (embeddings included) ranks documents independently, so near-duplicate
//! files all rank high and the caller pays for the same information K times.
//! An agent assembling context wants marginal novelty, not K copies of the
//! best answer. Coverage over priced aspects is submodular — the marginal gain
//! of a doc can only shrink as the picked set grows — so the classic greedy
//! sweep (Nemhauser–Wolsey–Fisher 1978) is within (1−1/e) of the optimal set.
//! Exact, model-free, deterministic.
//!
//! **What "explains" means, and why it is graded.** The first version covered
//! an aspect the moment a document contained its literal, which made pack
//! degenerate at the query lengths agents type: a six-word query has ~5 priced
//! aspects, so the first file mentioning all six reported 100% coverage from
//! one pick and the submodular machinery never engaged — and "mentions the
//! word" is not "explains the thing", so a changelog that name-dropped every
//! term beat the module the query was about. Coverage is now the saturating
//! density of Lin & Bilmes' facility-location objective (ACL 2011) over BM25's
//! length-normalized term frequency: a file that merely mentions an aspect
//! leaves most of its bits for a later pick that is really about it. Full
//! derivation in `kernel/kinship/recall/coverage.zig`.
//!
//! **A score is not an answer** — the property `similar` had and this verb did
//! not. Coverage is graded on the `context` channel's calibrated bands, the
//! answer's grade is the PACK's (a reading set is one answer, not N
//! independent rows), `--min-grade` withholds a pack made of background, and a
//! thin pack explains itself on stderr in gist's hint grammar. Every pick also
//! names the aspects that account for its gain, which is the justification a
//! bits number alone cannot give.
//!
//! `--matching PAT` prices novelty inside the exact filter instead of over the
//! whole corpus: the patterns select the candidate docs, aspects are priced
//! from ONLY those, and each pick carries the patterns that admitted it. This
//! is what `irregex context` was — a verb for a modifier, which meant the
//! composed shape could not be combined with anything else pack learned.
//! Whole-corpus packing surfaces whatever the corpus finds cheap regardless of
//! intent; narrowing first makes "the reading set among files that actually
//! mention X" a single query. The two scores stay in separate
//! columns — the admitting patterns and the compression bits — and are never
//! fused into one relevance number.
//!
//! The score story stays honest: `coverage` is the fraction of the query's
//! PRICED description the picks jointly hold. Aspects no document contains are
//! `foreign` and aspects every document contains are `glue`; both price at zero
//! for opposite reasons, are reported separately, and never pad the
//! denominator so coverage can only be a fraction of what the corpus could
//! actually pay.
//!
//! Corpus policy: the index corpus. Nomination reuses Gist's mmap-backed
//! trigram codebook and shared freshness fold, then reads a bounded pool
//! because only bytes distinguish mention from subject; a missing index falls
//! back to the live corpus scan. Results stdout, diagnostics stderr.
