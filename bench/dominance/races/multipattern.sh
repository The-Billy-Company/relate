# multipattern.sh — Layer K: simultaneous multi-pattern matching vs Hyperscan.
#
# The question is not "can gist grep". It is the one Hyperscan (Intel; portable
# fork **Vectorscan**, NEON/SVE) was built for and is the reference on: compile N
# expressions into one matcher, walk bytes once, and report WHICH expression hit
# — expression-ID attribution at throughput. gist's surface for it is
# `PatternSet` (`irregex/src/kernel/slate/`), shipped as `relate patterns -e P -e P …`.
#
# TWO RACES, because there are two questions and only one of them is the user's:
#
#   arm 1 · PER BYTE (Hyperscan's home turf).  Both matchers over ONE resident
#           blob — `bench/rungs/multipattern/pack.py` packs it from gist's own
#           `paths.list`, so the bytes and their order are identical and neither
#           side pays for a tree walk. Swept over N, because the whole claim is
#           about how cost scales with the size of the question.
#
#   arm 2 · END TO END (the actual workload).  "Find these N patterns across the
#           corpus." Hyperscan is a STREAM scanner: it must touch every byte of
#           every file, and no per-byte speed can recover the bytes it cannot
#           skip. gist has an index. Four honest strategies race:
#
#             gist patterns   one walk, index-filtered, attributed  ← the claim
#             vectorscan      one automaton over every byte, attributed
#             rg alternation  one walk, fast, and CANNOT say which pattern hit
#             rg × N          N processes, attributed, N tree walks
#
#           `rg alternation` is in the field precisely because it is what a real
#           engineer types, and its column is a reminder that it answers a
#           WEAKER question — the attribution has to be re-derived afterwards.
#
# Vectorscan is a COMPETITOR, never a dependency: it is found via `pkg-config
# libhs` (brew install vectorscan), built into `.local/`, and when it is absent
# every Vectorscan cell is skipped with a stated reason. A certificate that
# fabricates a rival is worse than one that admits a missing column.
#
# Fail-closed on meaning before speed: gist's arm re-derives the whole
# attribution vector with N INDEPENDENT single-pattern searches (`--verify`) and
# the two tools' per-pattern document counts are diffed against each other. A
# timing that does not agree on the ANSWER is not published.
#
