# relate vs the field — the RELATE race: retrieval by conditional description
# length ("which files would describe this text most cheaply?").
#
# This class has no exact-search competitor: the queries are PARAPHRASES —
# reworded fragments that appear verbatim in no file — so gist/rg answer 0
# hits by design (proven below, not asserted). The honest baseline is what an
# agent actually does today with an exact-search tool: split the query into
# tokens, run one gist per token, and rank files by aggregate hit count. The
# race is therefore three-lane:
#
#   relate similar one pass over a TEXT probe — persisted trigram codebook
#                  nominates, then a bounded suffix-automaton cross-parse decides
#                  (src/exec/retrieval/retrieval.zig)
#   gist exact     the paraphrase as a literal — must find NOTHING (capability
#                  line, not a timing lane)
#   gist tokens    K single-token gist runs + awk count aggregation — today's
#                  workflow, timed end-to-end
#
# QUALITY GATE (regression guard): relate must rank the planted source file
# top-1 for every paraphrase query. A miss exits 1 — this script doubles as
# the relate-class regression check, not just a stopwatch.
#
# Corpus: synthetic + deterministic (never the coworker-mutated live tree):
# COUNT files of source-shaped text sharing heavy boilerplate, each with its
# own topical vocabulary; queries are minted from K of them by rewording.
# Usage:
#   bench/races/relate_headtohead.sh            (COUNT=400 RUNS=8)
#   COUNT=800 RUNS=12 bench/races/relate_headtohead.sh
