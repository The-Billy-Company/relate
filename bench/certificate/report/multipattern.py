"""gist certify — Layer K report (simultaneous multi-pattern matching vs Hyperscan).

Reads what `bench/races/multipattern.sh` measured and splices a self-contained
**Layer K** section into CERTIFICATE.md between stable sentinels, idempotent
across re-mints.

Layer K is the one layer with a named external champion. Hyperscan (Intel;
portable fork **Vectorscan**) is the reference for expression-ID attribution at
throughput, so this layer does not claim dominance — it claims a **boundary**,
and publishes the side of it where gist loses as plainly as the side where it
wins. Two arms, because the per-byte question and the user's question are not the
same question:

  arm 1  per byte, same resident blob, swept over N. Hyperscan's home turf.
  arm 2  end to end over the corpus. A stream scanner must touch every byte;
         gist has an index, and no per-byte speed recovers bytes never read.

Fail-closed, meaning before speed — any of these refuses the splice:

  K1 EQUALITY      every N in the sweep re-derived its whole attribution vector
                   from N INDEPENDENT single-pattern searches and agreed. This is
                   the `PatternSet` contract; a timing is never published without
                   it, because a wrong answer has no throughput.
  K2 CROSS-TOOL    gist and Vectorscan agree on the per-pattern document counts.
                   Two engines, one answer — the diff is the proof both arms
                   raced the same question. (Skipped, never faked, when
                   Vectorscan is absent.)
  K3 SWEEP         the per-byte sweep is present and every cell is a real
                   measurement.
  K4 SIGNIFICANCE  every end-to-end WIN this layer prints is a Mann-Whitney win
                   at alpha=0.05 over per-run times. A win that is not
                   significant is reported as parity, and the headline claim
                   (gist over the stream scanner) must be a real win or the mint
                   aborts.

Statistics come from `stats.py` (medians, bootstrap CI, tie-corrected
Mann-Whitney) — this file computes none of its own.
