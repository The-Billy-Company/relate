# certify_relate.sh — Layer G of the Dominance-and-Fit Certificate (the relate face).
#
# relate answers a question exact search CANNOT: "which files would DESCRIBE this
# text most cheaply?" — retrieval by conditional description length, not pattern
# match. It inherits no Layer-A dominance claim because it is not the same query;
# Layer G certifies what relate actually promises — a retrieval-quality contract
# and the boundary that defines its territory. It is FAIL-CLOSED on four claims
# (the report enforces all four; any violation aborts the mint):
#
#   G1 BOUNDARY      — every paraphrase query finds 0 hits under exact `gist -F`.
#                      The class is provably outside exact search (proven, not
#                      asserted): this is *why* relate exists.
#   G2 RECALL@1      — `relate similar <text>` ranks the planted source file
#                      top-1 for every paraphrase (recall@1 = 100%). A text probe
#                      with no channel IS the retrieval question; the verb that
#                      used to spell it `search` folded into `similar`.
#   G3 PACK          — `relate pack` over a two-topic query returns BOTH planted
#                      sources (anti-redundant multi-source retrieval).
#   G4 SHORT RECALL  — `relate similar dog` recalls the single 3-byte planted
#                      needle (sub-trigram recall the persisted codebook handles).
#
# Corpus is synthetic + deterministic (never the coworker-mutated live tree):
# COUNT files sharing heavy boilerplate, each with its own topical vocabulary;
# queries are paraphrases of three planted files, reworded so they appear
# verbatim in no file. Self-contained so the certificate reproduces from its own
# bytes (mirrors bench/races/relate_headtohead.sh, the sibling stopwatch).
