"""Re-pin a Cargo.lock's own packages to the manifests beside them.

A lockfile records a version for every package in the resolved graph, and some
of those packages are ours: this crate, and the sibling engine it is built over.
Nothing rewrites those numbers. release-please moves a manifest through its
`x-release-please-version` annotation and stops there, and `irregex` versions
on a schedule of its own and moves without asking this repository at all. So a
committed lock drifts from the workspace it claims to describe, from both
directions, and `cargo publish --locked` — whose whole job is to publish the
graph that was tested — refuses to reconcile the difference. relate's v1.1.0
died exactly there, and gist lost two releases to the same thing.

The repair is a `version = "..."` rewrite and nothing else. Local packages are
discovered by walking the manifest graph from a starting directory — the root
package, then each `path` dependency, transitively — and each one's declared
version is read off disk and written into its `[[package]]` block. No registry
is contacted and nothing is re-resolved, so no third-party pin can move: what
gets published is still the graph that was tested, one version number later.

Driven from the lock rather than from the manifests, so a local package that is
outside the resolved graph (an optional path dependency, say) is reported and
skipped instead of demanded. The one hard requirement is the root package's own
block — without it this lock does not belong to this manifest, and rewriting it
would be a guess.
