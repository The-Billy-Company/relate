"""The corpus substrate every compression verb stands on.

`gist` searches a *tree* the way ripgrep does — one file at a time, honoring
`.gitignore`. The compression verbs instead read a **corpus**: every non-binary
file under the roots minus VCS and build subtrees, treated as one statistical
population. That difference is why they live behind a different substrate, and
this module is it — the vocabulary shared by `kinship`, `retrieval`, `sweep`,
`compose`, and `radius`:

  * `Scope` / `scope_argv` — which roots a question covers, where one bare path
    is one root rather than an iterable of characters.
  * `Region` — a span of the corpus, and (Python-only) the bytes it points at.
  * `Kin` — rows *plus how the answer was produced*, so a caller can tell
    "nearest of three" from "nearest of twenty thousand".
  * `run` — invoke one verb of `relate` or `irregex`, returning its NDJSON rows
    and the stderr summary record the CLI shows a human.

Nothing here computes kinship. Distances, grades, and attribution are the
kernel's; this layer only carries them across the process boundary with their
provenance intact.
