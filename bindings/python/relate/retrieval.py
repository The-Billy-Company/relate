"""Compression retrieval — ask the corpus what a piece of text costs it.

The other half of relate (`kinship.py` is the first): where kinship compares two
things already in the tree, retrieval takes *text you have* and prices it
against everything the tree knows. Three questions:

  * `recall(text)` — which single files would describe this text most cheaply?
    Content recall with no regex and no exact spelling required: the answer to
    "gist found nothing and I'm not sure what it's called".
  * `pack(text)` — which *set* of files jointly explains it cheapest, each pick
    priced by the bits it adds **beyond the picks before it**? Near-duplicates
    of an earlier pick never make the cut, which is what makes this a reading
    list rather than a ranking.
  * `quote(text)` — rewrite the text as verbatim corpus quotations, each phrase
    priced in bits and attributed to a source file. Where did this snippet come
    from, and how much of it is genuinely new?

`recall` and `pack` both take `matching=[…]`: the exact engine narrows the corpus
first and the pricing happens only inside what matched. Compression is
a statistical measure and knows nothing about a word, so unnarrowed it will
happily rank a file that never mentions the subject.

Everything is denominated in bits because that is what compression measures:
a low cost means the corpus already knows this text. Scores are the kernel's;
nothing is re-derived here. For attribution that is also re-verified against the
files' *current* bytes, use `compose.provenance` instead of `quote`.
