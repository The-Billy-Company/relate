"""N patterns, one walk, exact per-pattern attribution.

The odd one out among the relate verbs: nothing here is compression. `patterns`
is an *exact* multi-pattern sweep that lives in the relate binary because it
shares the corpus walk — the loom runs every pattern against each file as it is
read once, instead of re-reading the tree per pattern.

That makes it the right tool for a question no single search answers: *"which of
these twenty things appear, and where?"* Sequential `gist -l` calls pay the walk
N times and then make the caller re-derive which pattern produced which hit;
this returns the attribution the engine already knew. Roughly 6× faster than the
sequential shape at N≈3, and the gap widens with N.

`pattern_counts` goes further and never ships rows at all — the grouping happens
engine-side, so a "how many of each?" question costs one number per group rather
than one line per hit.
