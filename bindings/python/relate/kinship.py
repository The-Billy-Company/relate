"""Kinship — what resembles what, without anyone spelling a pattern.

Where `gist` answers *"where is this exact string?"*, kinship answers the
questions regex cannot: *what resembles this file, which units are the same
thing, what shares a skeleton under different names, which of these is genuinely
unique*. Similarity is measured by compression — two things are close when
knowing one makes the other cheap to describe — so nothing needs to be named in
advance.

**Two questions, not six verbs.** Everything here is one of:

  * `similar(probe)` — the *neighbor* question: rank the corpus against ONE
    thing. The probe may be a file, one function out of a file (`path#L120`), or
    text; its shape decides how it is priced.
  * `pairs()` / `families()` / `distinct()` — the *repetition* question: what
    repeats inside a corpus, reported as the two things you can inspect and the
    one thing you can act on. All three take the same three axes — `unit`
    (file · function · match), `channel` (copies · twins · shapes · any), and an
    optional `matching` exact filter — because repetition is a point in that
    space rather than a family of verbs. `families` is the shape a dedup or
    restructure sweep acts on; `distinct` is its complement, which turns "which
    of these 14 implementations is unique?" into a measurement with a receipt.

Three things make this a library surface rather than a transcription of the CLI:

  * **Every row carries its calibrated `Grade`.** A raw distance misleads — 0.78
    over a 21k-file corpus means "both are Python", not "related". The CLI warns
    a human about that on stderr; a caller gets `row.grade` and the engine-side
    `min_grade=` filter instead.
  * **Every answer carries its provenance.** `Kin` is the row sequence *plus* the
    population it was drawn from, whether it came warm from the persisted atlas,
    and how long it took. An empty result over 21095 scored units is a completely
    different fact from an empty result over 55, and only one of them means
    "widen the scope".
  * **The score is named for its polarity.** A distance closes toward zero, a
    `twins` gap and a `recall` gain grow. Rows keep them in separate fields
    (`distance`/`echo`/`gain` on the wire, `score` plus `channel` here); nothing
    is ever fused into one number.

Distances and grades are computed in the kernel; nothing is re-derived here.
Corpus policy is the verbs' own — see `relate/contract/kinship.toml`.
