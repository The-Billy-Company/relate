"""Behavioral tests for the kinship face and the batched pattern sweep.

Two questions and their axes: the neighbor question (`similar`, over a file, a
function fragment, or text) and the repetition question (`pairs` / `families` /
`distinct`, over a unit and a channel, inside an optional exact filter), plus the
exact multi-pattern walk (`patterns` / `pattern_counts`). These drive the real
binaries over a throwaway corpus, so they skip cleanly where none is built — the
same discipline as `test_search.py`.

Oracles are independent. Attribution is checked against single-pattern searches
through the established `gist.files` face; the family closure is checked by
running union-find over the *pair* rows in the test rather than trusting the
engine's own grouping; the narrowing filter is checked against an exact search
for the same pattern; and the fixtures are built so the expected answer follows
from their construction. Nothing is asserted against a verb's own output.
