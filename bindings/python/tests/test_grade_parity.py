"""The Python calibration must be the Zig calibration, proven from the Zig source.

`irregex/grade.py` is a mirror of `src/kernel/kinship/metric/channel.zig`, and a
mirror is a liability the moment it drifts: a caller filtering on
`min_grade="strong"` would silently mean something different from the same flag
on the CLI. So the oracle here is the kernel source — channel aliases, band cut
points, polarity, and the enum orderings are *parsed out of `channel.zig`* and
compared against the Python values. Nothing is asserted against a number typed
twice.

Calibration lives in the kernel rather than in the renderer because the bands are
a property of the metric: the repetition kernel grades a family edge with the same
cut points the CLI prints. `surface/cli/grade.zig` re-exports them.

If the kernel re-calibrates a band, these fail until the mirror follows. That is
the point.
