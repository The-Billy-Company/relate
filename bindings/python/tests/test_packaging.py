"""The shipped library must load from an install directory, not only from the tree that built it.

`linkLibrary` records the dependency's own build output directory as an rpath, and
in this build that is a *relative* `.zig-cache/o/<hash>` path — true on the machine
that produced it and meaningless everywhere else. A product dylib carrying only
that rpath cannot resolve `@rpath/libirgx.dylib` when a consumer opens it, so it
fails at load with no call ever reaching the engine. `build.zig` adds a
loader-relative rpath so the shape we actually ship — every library in one lib
directory — is the loadable one; this is the gate on that.

The load must happen in a CHILD process with a clean environment. Once this
interpreter has opened the substrate, the loader satisfies a later `@rpath`
reference from the already-loaded image by install name, which is precisely how
the bindings kept working while a bare `dlopen` from anywhere else did not. A
same-process check would inherit that rescue and assert nothing.
