"""The shipped library must load from an install directory, and must not fork the engine's vocabulary.

`linkLibrary` records the dependency's own build output directory as an rpath, and
in this build that is a *relative* `.zig-cache/o/<hash>` path — true on the machine
that produced it and meaningless everywhere else. A product dylib carrying only
that rpath cannot resolve `@rpath/libirgx.dylib` when a consumer opens it, so it
fails at load with no call ever reaching the engine. `build.zig` adds a
loader-relative rpath so the shape we actually ship — every library in one lib
directory — is the loadable one; this is the gate on that.

The load must happen in a CHILD process with a clean environment. Once this
interpreter has opened the substrate, the loader satisfies a later `@rpath`
reference from the already-loaded image by install name, which is precisely how
the bindings kept working while a bare `dlopen` from anywhere else did not. A
same-process check would inherit that rescue and assert nothing.

The second invariant is about symbols rather than files, and it is the one
`build.zig` states: librelate links the substrate so that it **does not redefine**
`irgx_*`, and a host that also loads libgist therefore sees one engine
vocabulary rather than three. What librelate does carry is the engine's Zig code,
statically, because that is what linking a Zig module means — so "one copy of the
engine" is not the property to gate and never was. The gate is that exactly one
library in the process answers to an `irgx_*` name. That holds by construction
across the two copies because the FFI layer allocates through
`std.heap.c_allocator`: a row minted inside librelate's copy and freed inside
libirgx's crosses one process-wide malloc heap, not two allocators.

This used to be gated by deleting the substrate beside a staged librelate and
requiring the load to fail. That is a proxy for the symbol question, and an
environment-sensitive one: Zig records the dependency's cache directory as a
search path, `ZIG_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR` makes it absolute on CI while it is relative
on a dev machine, and an absolute one resolves the deleted library right back out
of the build cache. So the proxy asserted the invariant on one machine and
nothing at all on another. It reads the export table now.
