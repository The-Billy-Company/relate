"""Behavioral tests for compression retrieval — `recall` / `pack` / `quote`.

These drive the real `relate` binary over a throwaway corpus with its artifact
home redirected into `tmp_path`, so the tests never read or write the developer's
index and `quote` gets a shelf of its own to attribute against.

The oracles are properties the *engine* is claiming, not restatements of its
output: a file that contains the query text must be recalled above one that does
not; `pack` must never pick a near-duplicate of an earlier pick; a quoted phrase
must actually occur in the file it is attributed to.
