//! Search by resemblance rather than by pattern — the twelve `relate` verbs.
//!
//! Three question shapes, twelve entry points:
//!
//! * **kinship** ([`Kinship`]) — *what resembles what*: `similar` from one file,
//!   or a corpus-wide `dups`/`clusters`/`echoes`/`concepts`/`fragments`/
//!   `distinct` sweep.
//! * **retrieval** ([`Retrieval`]) — *what explains this text*: `recall`, the
//!   anti-redundant `pack`, and `quote`'s per-phrase attribution.
//! * **sweep** ([`Sweep`]) — *N patterns, one walk*: `patterns` and the folded
//!   `pattern_counts`.
//!
//! Every verb answers with [`Rows`](irregex::runtime::Rows) — the same cursor, decoded
//! against the schema the contract binds to that op. Read fields by name
//! ([`Row::text`](irregex::runtime::Row::text), [`f64`](irregex::runtime::Row::f64),
//! [`variant`](irregex::runtime::Row::variant), [`rows`](irregex::runtime::Row::rows)); a field the
//! engine did not fill is `None`, which for a distance is not the same as `0.0`.
