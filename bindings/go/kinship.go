// Package relate is the compression plane: the questions a regex cannot ask.
// What resembles this file, what repeats in this corpus, which files explain this
// text most cheaply, and where did this pasted snippet come from.
//
// Every verb here scores kinship by how cheaply one thing describes another, and
// every score arrives banded ([analytic.Grade]) so background never reads as a
// hit: an answer of five strangers at distance 0.78 says so instead of looking
// like a find. Ask for a floor with Kinship.MinGrade rather than filtering after
// the fact — the engine withholds weaker rows, which is cheaper and honest.
//
// A [Corpus] is a scope, not a handle: it holds no resources and is safe to keep
// and share. Each verb runs one query through the runtime's ladder — the
// in-process analytic plane when it can, the certified `relate` binary otherwise.
